it's day 3 . i asked chatgpt for today's task and he told me to make:

A Simple Student Grade Calculator that can 
  dynamically take input 
  calculate and print 
    total marks 
    percentage 
    grade

Lets solve it like this :
  we need to take input and store in a variable
  create a loop based on input to take all subject's marks
  then add the marks of all subjects and create the percentage with loop
  based on percentage grade each subject and overall with if-else conditions
