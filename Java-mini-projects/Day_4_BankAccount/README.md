Today marks the 4th day from when i statred doing java daily. 

Today's task was to create a simple ATM interface 

The objectives given to me by chatgpt were :
  1. The code should show a menu where the user can select different operations like:
      - Withdraw
      - Deposit
      - Check Balance
      - Exit
  2. Take the input from user
  3. Handle invalid inputs.
  4. Prevent withdrawal if amount > Balance
  5. Keep the app running until the user selects exit


Logic : 
  1. Today I will use classes and methods to solve the problem
  2. I will create different methods for each operation in ATM and a different class to declare the input 
  3. While loop for the purpose of running the program repeatedly 
  4. Switch case for different cases and handling invalid input 
  5. if conditions for prevention of withdrawal when amount > Balance

Chatgpt assistance :
  1. Today the logic was clear but as I did not know the syntax of java I used chatgpt for some syntax related errors
  2. The part where the user enters value and the value is not of the desired type , I used chatgpt to solve the problem 


After using  try and catch for one input I am thinking of using it for other input as well , but is it good to make the code messier ?
