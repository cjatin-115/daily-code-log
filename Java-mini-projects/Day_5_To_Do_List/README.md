Today marks the 5th day from when I started my daily java coding journey .

Today's task was to create a To-do list kind of task manager .

The assigned task was to create a to do list with features like :
  1. Add task
  2. View all tasks
  3. Mark task as done
  4. Delete task 
  5. Exit app
  Bonus :
  1. Use oops for better functionality and scalability


Logic :
  1. create 2 classes : 
    a. Tasks
    b. TodoList
  2. In tasks add method to mark task as done 
  3. import and use array to store tasks.
  4. using while loop and swtich cases like yesterday for the menu and operations 
  5. created different classes for different functions hence reducing the size of main block

Chatgpt assistance :
  1. OOPS , i was new to OOPS so ....mostly took the Tasks framework from ai

Today the vs code auto recomendation did most of the work but it helped me to understand the basics of coding and how to write clean codes and with todays task i now know :
  1. How to take inputs 
  2. How to create classes
  3. How to make methods in classes 
  4. About ArrayList  which is a type of list with dynamic size shrinks and expands on need
  5. How to write cleaner codes make the compilation time smaller by keeping the main block small and only compiling other functions when needed


thanks for staying with me , goodbye !!
